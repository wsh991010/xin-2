<p><b>The title of my project is what’s in the mirror, and the subtitle is a bookstore with secrets.</b></p>

  <p>From the perspective of issues, I transformed the narrative methods in movies and novels into design elements, and added the appearance of the site to create a narrative atmosphere and experience of the space.
  </p>
  
  <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;font-style: italic;color: #ffffff;">We who live in the mirror all our lives, is there any chance to escape?</p>

<p>This is my research on mirrors, and I will explain it from the perspective of psychology. </p>

  <p>The first psychological theory is the Stage of mirror, which states that the self recognized through the mirror is not real, but an illusion in the mirror. 
    The second theory is looking glass self, which states that an individual's concept of himself is based on how others react to him. </p>
  
  <p>These two psychological theories are mainly explaining how to transform from a biological individual into a social person. People form their self-image in constant interpersonal interaction, but some people seem to be trapped in this existing image, unable to truly express their true self.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px;font-style: italic; color: aliceblue;">I think the mirror is like a medium in my design. People know themselves through the concept of mirror, but they also lose themselves because of the mirror. I hope to escape the illusion in the mirror through the space design, wake up the real self outside the mirror.

<p> I use the way of narrative to start. The main character of the story is an group I set up. Life forces them to wear masks and live like themselves. This group is a homosexual group, and some homosexuals need a disguised space in their lives, in which they can show their true selves. 
  <p>The first psychological theory is the Stage of mirror, which states that the self recognized through the mirror is not real, but an illusion in the mirror. 
    The second theory is looking glass self, which states that an individual's concept of himself is based on how others react to him. </p>
  
  <p>Then I analyzed the city from the perspective of homosexuals, such as Ximen Red House and Taipei New Park are their gathering places. My site is two blocks away from the Red House . Although it is not far from the Red House, it is a quiet place . The site is located next to Nishi Honganji Temple, which is quiet and has a historical and cultural atmosphere.
  <p>The site  is not as lively as Ximending, where residents come for a walk or walk their dogs. </p>
  <p>You can see that there is a wide park in the north of the site, and you will see narrow alleys when you pass through the site. As the distance shrinks, the distance between people also gets closer.

<p>There is the planting analysis of the courtyard and the park. A total of five large trees, one small tree and some shrubs are planted.</p>
<p>The selection of tree species in the courtyard . I chose Neem and Crapemyrtle. These two tree species bloom in spring and summer, and will drop fruits or flowers in winter, giving the ground a new color.

</p>
  <p>The trees I chose to plant in the park are Liquidambar  and Flamegold. Liquidambar will change color with the temperature, and Flamegold  will show different colors in four seasons.
  </p>
  
  <p>On the north side, I designed a large staircase, which can lead to  Nishi Honganji Temple. People can walk into the building along the stairs.The direction seen from the park is the north side, which is composed of volumes and has more expression elements.  This is how I present the two sides of the architecture.

<p> My design is a bookstore, but it is not an ordinary bookstore. This bookstore opens a special late-night period for those who want to read at night. A special "friendship" place, people who come here can hide themselves under the appearance of the bookstore.
  <p>This design has two main elevations, the north and the south. </p>
  <p>The south side is mainly facing Guiyang Street. People walking on the street can see this elevation. This side is the daily life of the city. I want to present the unchanging daily life, it’s an ordinary street scape, keeping its original elevation. </p>
    <p>On the north side, I designed a large staircase, which can lead to  Nishi Honganji Temple. People can walk into the building along the stairs.The direction seen from the park is the north side, which is composed of volumes and has more expression elements.

<p style="font-size: 14px;font-style: italic; color: aliceblue;"> So what’s in the mirror?
</p>

<p>The entrance is the side that face to Gui-Yang street, there is a tunnel that can see the courtyard. From the outside, it looks like an unexpected place.
   </p>
  <p>On the other side, walk along the road of Nishi Honganji Temple to the park and feel the richness of trees and shrubs. Walking along a winding and secret path, A building appear in the distance... 
  </p>
   <p>Entering through the arch-shaped tunnel, this space is filled with plants, it is a world different from the street. </p>
<p>t's a book- store hidden inside the coffee shop's exterior. 
    
    So you can't reach this bookstore easily. </p>
  <div style="height: 25px;"></div>

  <p style="font-size: 14px;font-style: italic; color: aliceblue;"> In the bookstore.
  </p>
<p>The central staircase is integrated with bookshelves, Sunlight filters through the small windows and fills the interior, creating a cozy space perfect for reading. 
</p>
  <p>
    Although this hidden bookstore is not big, it has many hidden nooks for reading. 
  </p>
<p>Walking up the stairs, you can look down and see people and stairs weaving through the bookshelves. 
  Perhaps it's a great opportunity to bump into someone? 
</p>

<p>This place is out of the bookstore, and People's purpose is not to find books, is find someone to have an encounter.

</p>
<p>
  Walking outside from the narrow passage, looking down at the pedestrians on the street is like seeing yourself.

</p>

<p>
  Finally, out of the mirror, Looking back, it is a different elevation from the entrance, it’s a another expression for another self.
